### Feedback

```
There is a lot of room for interpretation. I think it is important for a developer to stay within the scope of the assignment. Since there is so much room for interpretation. I have a lot of questions about this wireframe. f.e.
- should we build in routes?
- what happens if I use the checkbox for a certain user?
- Am I allowed to change the status of the specific user? (Why is the endpoint not given)
- etc.

In my current role I learned that I should leave as less room for assumptions as possible. So I stick to the wireframe and try to develop only what is asked.

For future assignments for applicants I would suggest that you add some more specific information.
